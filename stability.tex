\subsection{The Green--Griffiths conjecture}

% TODO: intro / context

\begin{conjecture}[Green--Griffiths, \cite{griffiths_80}]
    Let $X$ be a smooth complex variety of general type. Then $X$ admits no
    Zariski dense holomorphic curves.
\end{conjecture}

We are considering a holomorphic map $f:\C\to X$, which induces also a map
$df:\C\to\P(T_X)$. Writing $\O(-1)$ for the relative tautological bundle on
$\P(T_X)$, we have (tautologically) $(df)^*\O(-1)=T_C$. Now suppose $\O(1)$ is
big. This assumption is intended as an approximation of the condition of being
general type. We may find an effective divisor $D\ge0$ in $\P(T_X)$ representing
$\O(1)$, which is locally a section of the bundle over $X$, although possibly
not globally. Up to finite degree issues, this gives a rational section of
$\P(T_X)$, which as mentioned earlier is precisely the data of a foliation, say
$\scrF$, on $X$.

Now from $(df)^*\O(-1)=T_C$ we get $(df)^*\O(1)=K_C=2g(C)-2$, so if $C$ is
rational $C\cdot D<0$. But this forces $C$ to be a component of $D$, and so in
fact $\scrF$ is tangent to $C$. % why?
In other words, from the assumption that $\O(1)$ is big we have produced a
foliation on $X$ which is tangent to every rational curve in $X$. The existence
of such a foliation is a strong constraint, and this argument is part of work
due to Bogomolov and McQuillan \cite{mcquillan_98} which lead to certain
restricted results related to the conjecture.

It turns out that the condition of $\O_{\P(T_X)}(1)$ being big as a property of
the vector bundle $T_X$ is equivalent to a notion of ampleness for $T_X$, as
defined in \cite{hartshorne_66}. % TODO: details / sketch

\subsection{Ampleness and slope stability}

Motivated by the previous arguments, suppose we want an example of a surface $X$
such that $\O_{\P(T_X)}(1)$ is big, or equivalently $T_X$ is ample. For a
somewhat flexible class of general type surfaces, we will look among high degree
hypersurfaces in $\P^3$. Consider $X$ cut out by a section of $\O_{\P^3}(d)$. We
have the normal bundle exact sequence
\begin{equation*}
    0 \to N_{X/\P^3}^\vee \to \Omega^1_{\P^3}|_X \to \Omega^1_X \to 0,
\end{equation*}
where $N_{X/\P^3}=\O(-d)$ by adjunction. Taking determinants, we see that
$\O(-4)=K_{\P^3}=K_X\otimes\O(-d)$, so at least $\det\Omega^1_X=K_X$ is ample
for $d\gg0$. It is not true that a vector bundle is ample whenever its
determinant bundle is ample (although the converse does hold), % TODO: example, proof
but in this particular case it is actually sufficient due to the following
result.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:stable ample}
    If $\calE$ is a vector bundle such that $\det\calE$ is ample, and $\calE$ is
    slope semi-stable, then $\calE$ is ample.
\end{proposition}

% TODO: proof

In order to apply this, we appeal to two major theorems:

\begin{theorem}[Aubin, Yau]
    For a general type smooth complex projective variety, the tangent bundle
    admits a K\"ahler--Einstein metric.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Kobayashi, L\"ubke]
    If the tangent bundle of a smooth complex projective variety admits a
    K\"ahler--Einstein metric, then it is slope stable.
\end{theorem}

Note that stability of a vector bundle is equivalence to stability of its dual,
so these results imply stability of $\Omega^1_X$ allowing us to apply
\cref{prop:stable ample}.

% TODO: easier reason for Omega^1_X stability?

% TODO: construct example, find the foliation?

% TODO: ample definitions

% TODO: slope stability definitions

% only consider slope stability, drop slope

This definition is motivated by the application of Mumford's geometric invariant
theory in the construction of moduli spaces of sheaves. A key theorem in the
stability theory of sheaves is the following:

\begin{theorem}[Donaldson--Uhlenbeck--Yau]
    If $X$ is a smooth complex projective manifold, then a holomorphic vector
    bundle $\calE$ on $X$ is slope polystable iff it admits a Hermite--Einstein
    metric.
    % irreducible vector bundles => can drop poly
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
    For a vector bundle $V$, we have $V^*=V\otimes(\det V)^*$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}
    A vector bundle $\calE$ is (semi)stable iff $\calE^*$ is (semi)stable.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    If $\calE,\calE'$ are semistable vector bundles, then so is
    $\calE\otimes\calE'$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    If $\calE,\calE'$ are semistable vector bundles, then so is
    $\calE\oplus\calE'$.
\end{proposition}
