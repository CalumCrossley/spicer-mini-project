\section{Foliations and Blowups}

\subsection*{Foliations}

% TODO: extension problem needs sorting out
The map of vector bundles $T_\scrF\to T_X$ has cokernel which is a vector bundle
away from the locus where the relevant minors vanish. By assumption this locus
has codimension at least 2, so this vector bundle extends uniquely to a vector
bundle $N_\scrF$ on $X$, such that the cokernel is $\calI_\scrF\cdot N_\scrF$
where $\calI_\scrF$ is the ideal sheaf generated by these matrix minors. In the
surface case, this is the vanishing locus of the associated vector field.

\subsection*{Blowups}

\begin{example}
    Consider the foliation given by $\omega=x\d y-y\d x$ on $\A^2$. % TODO: tikz

    To better deal with all these curves through the singularity, we would like
    to blow up the origin. Write $X=\Bl_{(0,0)}\A^2=U\cup V$, where
    $U=\{(x,tx,1:t)\in\A^2\times\P^1\}$, $V=\{(sy,y,s:1)\in\A^2\times\P^1\}$.
    The pullbacks to $U$ and $V$ of $\omega$ are
    \begin{equation*}
        \omega|_U = x\d(tx)-tx\d x = x^2\d t, \quad
        \omega|_V = sy\d y - y\d(sy) = -y^2\d s.
    \end{equation*}
    These vanish to second order along the exceptional divisor $E$, but
    factoring this out we get 1-forms $\d t$ and $-\d s$ on $U$ and $V$ which patch
    together to give a nowhere vanishing 1-form with values in the line bundle
    $\O(2E)$. (Note that $\d t=-\d s/s^2$, $-\d s=\d t/t^2$.) Pictorially this
    is exactly as expected. % TODO: tikz
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    If we instead have the singularity $\omega=x\d y+y\d x$, then
    \begin{equation*}
        \omega|_U = x^2\d t + 2xt\d x, \quad
        \omega|_V = y^2\d s+2ys\d y.
    \end{equation*}
    So we have only first order vanishing along $E$, giving a 1-form valued in
    $\O(E)$, but with two lifts of the singularity from the local forms
    $x\d t+2t\d x$, $y\d s+2s\d y$. The exceptional divisor replaces the
    separatrix downstairs.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Finally, consider blowing up a smooth foliation; $\omega=\d x$. Then
    \begin{equation*}
        \omega|_U = \d x, \quad \omega|_V = s\d y+y\d s,
    \end{equation*}
    so we have introduced a singularity on the exceptional divisor, which
    crosses the strict transform of the unique separatrix downstairs. Note that
    the pullback doesn't vanish along $E$, so the normal bundle remains trivial.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $(X,\scrF)$ is a foliated surface, and $p\in X$. Under the blowup
    $\pi:\tilde X=\Bl_pX\to X$ we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \pi^*N_\scrF^\vee\to\pi^*\Omega^1_X\to\Omega^1_{\tilde X}
            \to J\cdot\pi^*K_\scrF \to 0,
    \end{equation*}
    where $J$ is the ideal sheaf of the total transform of $V(\calI_\scrF)$.
    This contains some multiple $nE$ as a component, and we get an induced map
    \begin{equation*}
        0\to \pi^*N_\scrF^\vee(-nE) \to \pi^*\Omega^1_X
            \to \tilde\calI_\scrF\cdot\pi^*K_\scrF \to 0
    \end{equation*}
    where $V(\tilde\calI_\scrF)$ has codimension at least 2.
\end{proposition}
